            <p>Who Am I?

                Hello! I’m Sukhjeet Singh, a passionate web developer and aspiring software engineer<br> dedicated to creating seamless, visually appealing, and highly functional websites. My journey into<br> web development began with a simple curiosity about how websites were built and an eagerness to<br> learn the technology behind them.Over the years, that curiosity evolved into a deep passion and commitment to developing innovative digital experiences.</p>
               <br> 
              <li><h2> My Background</h2></li>
                <p>
                I started my educational journey in non-medical field by keeping the aim of doing engineering in future and now i am pursuing b-tech in computer science field in lovely professional university, which laid the foundation for my technical skills and introduced me to the exciting world of coding and development. Since then, I’ve taken various courses, attended some workshops, and completed few  projects to further enhance my knowledge. Each new project brings an opportunity to learn something new and refine my skills, which keeps me motivated and excited to continue growing in this field.</p>
                <br>
              <li><h2> My Approach to Development</h2></li>
                
               <p> My approach to web development emphasizes three core values: functionality, design, and user experience. I believe that a website should not only look beautiful but also be easy to navigate, responsive across devices, and efficient in performance. 
                
                When working on projects, I take a detail-oriented and solution-focused approach. Whether I’m working on a solo project or collaborating with a team, I strive to keep communication clear, timelines achievable, and goals aligned with the client’s vision. My work is driven by a desire to bring ideas to life in a way that’s both creative and functional.</p>
                <br>
              <li><h2> My Skills and Tools</h2></li>
                
               <p> Here are some of the technical skills and tools I’ve developed proficiency in:
                
                HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: My core skills in web development, which allow me to create interactive, dynamic, and responsive websites. I continually seek to enhance these foundational skills to keep up with the latest industry standards.
                
                As a developer, my ultimate goal is to make an impact through technology. I envision a career where I contribute to projects that improve people’s lives, whether by streamlining processes, enhancing communication, or creating new ways for people to connect. I’m constantly seeking opportunities to collaborate with like-minded individuals and organizations who share a commitment to innovation and excellence.
                
                In the near future, I aim to further develop my skills in full-stack development, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence. I believe that these technologies hold immense potential for the future, and I want to be at the forefront of this exciting evolution.</p>
                <br>
             <li><h2> Personal Interests</h2></li>
                
            <p>Outside of web development, I enjoy listening music, doing roller skating and gardening . These activities provide a creative outlet and allow me to recharge and come back to my work with fresh ideas and a renewed perspective. I also enjoy volunteering and participating in community events, as I believe it’s essential to give back and contribute to the community that has supported my journey so far.</p>
